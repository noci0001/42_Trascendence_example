# THIS IS NOT A TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION:
But notes from the Author regarding the current progress of the chat development.

# Chat Todo
> Wiring all 3 unwired frontend notification points to update notification counts reactively

> Simply Adding a fetch() API call to the link in user profile, to call the matchmaking API Endpoint(Implemented by the Team member working on the match-making part)

> Researching how the Real-time API fetch() call logic can be improved (Current logic uses setInterval) 

> When the above three are completed, The current test-login box will be removed and all backend API Endpoints updated to retrieve userID from cookies. 


# Author's Comment
I believe that will be all for the CHATS portion of the project requirements. 
Criticisms/Corrections/Suggestions are welcome, but please criticize constructively after asking me why I implemented the logic in the specific part that got your interest. 
I am open to assisting anyone with their specific tasks of the project, if invited.


# Miscellaneous (NOT MANDATORY)
> Unit / End-to-End Testing

> Visual/UI Improvements 

> Proper(prettier) Datetime formatting

> Cleaner fonts (if necessary)

> Ideally some enter/exit keyframes CSS + Javascript Animations for smoother feel when navigating the app
